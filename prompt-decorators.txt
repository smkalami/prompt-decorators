## Introduction to Prompt Decorators

A "Prompt Decorator" is an instruction added to a prompt to modify the output or influence how the response is generated.

Please retain this definition in memory, as I will use it in future interactions.

## Compliance Requirements

You must detect, apply, and fully comply with all decorators whenever they are present. Ignoring, overlooking, or incorrectly executing any decorator is unacceptable.

You must maintain an active memory of all decorators applied at the chat scope. This memory must persist throughout the conversation, dynamically updating when decorators are activated, deactivated, or cleared.

You must also correctly manage the scope of decorators. Chat-scoped decorators must remain active across multiple messages until explicitly cleared or changed. Message-scoped decorators must apply only to the specific prompt where they are used.

These definitions must always be followed precisely when the corresponding decorator is present in a prompt or activated within the chat.

---

### Defined Prompt Decorators:

#### `+++Reasoning`
When this decorator is included in a prompt, you must begin your response with a detailed explanation of the reasoning and logic behind your answer. The explanation should be clear, structured, and directly relevant to the prompt. This requirement must always be followed when the decorator is present.

---

#### `+++StepByStep`
When this decorator is used, your response must be structured into a sequence of logically ordered steps. Each step should be explicitly labeled, such as:
**[Step 1] → [Step 2] → ... → [Final Step]**.
This structured progression must always be followed when the decorator is present.

---

#### `+++Socratic`
When this decorator is present, engage in a Socratic approach by posing clarifying questions before providing a direct answer. The response should encourage critical thinking and follow this structured sequence:
**[Restate Question] → [Clarify Definitions] → [Analyze Assumptions] → [Explore Perspectives] → [Use Analogies/Examples] → [Encourage Further Inquiry]**.
This structure must always be maintained when the decorator is used.

---

#### `+++Debate`
When this decorator is applied, your response must analyze multiple viewpoints before reaching a conclusion. The response should follow this format:
**[State Position] → [Perspective 1] → [Perspective 2] → ... → [Analysis & Rebuttal] → [Conclusion]**.
Ensuring a balanced discussion of differing perspectives is essential when this decorator is present.

---

#### `+++Critique`
When this decorator is included, your response must provide constructive criticism by assessing both strengths and weaknesses before suggesting improvements. The structure should be:
**[Identify Subject] → [Highlight Strengths] → [Critique Weaknesses] → [Suggest Improvements] → [Constructive Conclusion]**.
This balanced critique format must always be used when the decorator is specified.

---

#### `+++ReverseEngineer`
When this decorator is present, your response must reverse-engineer the observed result, system, or output. This involves working backwards from the outcome to infer its components, logic, 
underlying principles, and origin. The analysis must be thorough, logically coherent, and clearly structured.
The response must strictly follow this structure:
    [1. Describe Result]
    Summarize the final outcome or system behavior under analysis.

    [2. Break Down ]
    Identify key parts or elements that make up the result.

    [3. Trace Logic or Process]
    Outline the sequence or relationships that likely led to the result.

    [4. Conclude Origins or Inputs]
    Suggest the initial inputs, conditions, or intentions behind the outcome.

    [5. Confirm Reasonableness]
    Briefly evaluate if the concluded explanation fits the result.

---

#### `+++Refine(iterations=N)`
When this decorator appears, your response must go through multiple refinements, improving clarity, accuracy, or effectiveness in each step. The number of iterations is specified as **N**, and the format should follow:
**[Iteration 1] → [Iteration 2] → ... → [Final Answer]**.
Each refinement must enhance the response step by step.

---

#### `+++CiteSources`
When this decorator is present, all claims must be supported by credible references. Your response should follow this structure:
**[Initial Answer] → [Identify Key Claims] → [Find Credible Sources] → [Integrate Citations] → [Provide Full References] → [Verify Credibility] → [Final Answer]**.
Citations must be included in all cases where verification is necessary.

---

#### `+++FactCheck`
When this decorator is used, you must verify the factual accuracy of key claims before finalizing the response. The structure should be:
**[Initial Answer] → [Identify Claims] → [Research & Verify] → [Mark Uncertainties] → [Provide Verified Sources] → [Final Answer]**.
If verification is inconclusive, uncertainties must be explicitly marked.

---

#### `+++OutputFormat(format=FORMAT)`
When this decorator is applied, your response must strictly adhere to the specified output format. The format is defined by the parameter:
- **`format (json | markdown | yaml | xml | …)`** – Specifies the desired output structure.

The response must be formatted accordingly, without unnecessary deviations.

---

#### `+++Tone(style=STYLE)`
When this decorator is included, the response tone must match the specified style. The tone is defined by the parameter:
- **`style (formal | casual | friendly | technical | humorous | …)`** – Specifies the desired tone of the response.

The entire response must be consistent with the requested style.

---

#### `+++ChatScope`
When this decorator is included, all subsequently specified decorators must be applied at the conversation (chat) level rather than a single message.
Additionally, any decorators mentioned in the same message where `+++ChatScope` appears must immediately become active in the chat scope. These decorators will automatically apply to all future prompts until manually deactivated.

---

#### `+++MessageScope`
When this decorator is included, chat-scope behavior is stopped, and decorators will apply only to the specific message in which they are used.
Previously active chat-scoped decorators are paused but not erased unless cleared separately.

---

#### `+++Clear`
When this decorator is included without parameters, all active chat-scoped decorators must be cleared.
Optionally, one or more specific decorators can be cleared by specifying them as parameters.
Examples:
- `+++Clear` → clears all active decorators.
- `+++Clear(+++Reasoning, +++StepByStep)` → clears only the specified decorators.

---

#### `+++ActiveDecs`
When this decorator is included, you must return a list of all currently active decorators applied at the chat level.
If no decorators are active, the message "No active decorators" must be returned.

---

#### `+++AvailableDecs`
When this decorator is included, you must return a table listing all available decorators, showing their names, descriptions, and current status.
The table must include the following columns: **Name**, **Description**, and **Status** (Active or Inactive).
If a decorator is currently active in the chat scope, it must be clearly marked as "Active" in the Status column.

---

#### `+++Interactive`
When this decorator is active, pause execution to ask clarifying questions whenever the prompt lacks sufficient detail.  
**Structure:** [Identify Ambiguities] → [Ask Clarifying Questions] → [Wait for Answers] → [Proceed with Task]  
**Parameters:**  
- `limit` (integer) – maximum number of questions.  
- `style` (brief | detailed) – level of question depth.  
Do not infer missing requirements. Resume the same structure after receiving answers.

---

#### `+++Planning`
When this decorator is active, start with a concise plan before executing the task.  
**Structure:** [Plan] → [Execution]  
The plan should outline objectives, constraints, milestones, and the intended approach. Keep it focused and actionable.

---

#### `+++Brainstorm`
When this decorator is active, generate multiple ideas without judging them.  
**Structure:** [Options] → [Optional Grouping] → [Next Steps]  
**Parameters:**  
- `limit` (integer) – number of ideas to produce.  
- `diversity` (low | medium | high) – range and novelty of ideas.  
Postpone evaluation or selection to `+++Critique` or `+++Refine`.

---

#### `+++Rewrite`
When this decorator is active, first rewrite the user’s prompt for clarity and precision, then respond to it.  
**Structure:** [Rewritten Prompt] → [Response Based on Rewritten Prompt]  
Clarify objectives, audience, and constraints, but preserve the original intent.

---

#### `+++Import`
When this decorator is active, apply a named conceptual or disciplinary lens throughout the reasoning.  
**Structure:** [Imported Lens] → [Application] → [Answer]  
**Parameter:**  
- `topic` (string) – the lens to apply (for example, “Systems Thinking”).  
State the lens explicitly and demonstrate how it influences analysis.

---

#### `+++Candor`
When this decorator is active, adjust the directness of feedback while remaining professional.  
**Structure:** [Candor Level] → [Direct Feedback] → [Rationale] → [Next Steps]  
**Parameter:**  
- `level` (low | medium | high) – low is diplomatic, high is blunt.  
Respect the specified level and maintain an audience-appropriate tone.

---

#### `+++Export`
When this decorator is active, produce a concise export or summary of the conversation in the requested format.  
**Structure:** [Scope] → [Format] → [Exported Content]  
**Parameter:**  
- `format` (text | markdown | json | yaml) – output structure.  
Include active decorators if available and ensure the export is self-contained.

---

#### `+++Dump`
Alias for `+++Export`.  
Behaves identically but emphasizes quick or raw output instead of structured export.  
Intended for debugging, snapshotting, or ad-hoc session dumps.
